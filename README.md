# CUB_GetStarted

As you can see, the WOWCube® entertainment system is the new type of game console. How to play it? We created Get Started as a tutorial app especially for you.

To launch the Get Started app, move the highlight to the Get Started icon by tilting the cube and double-tap the cube. The highlight always tries to stay on top.

The WOWCube® System is activated by twisting one of its sides relative to another. This takes you to the main menu. Each icon you can see on the screens is either a game or an application. To run an app of your choice, there is a white highlight in the form of a hexagonal frame. Tilt the cube to move the highlight from one icon to the other. Its position indicates which application is selected, so you can launch it.
